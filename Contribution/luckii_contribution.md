issue name _ research existing favicon sites
issue link _ https://github.com/zuri-training/favicon-gen-team-66/issues/16

Purpose of the issue - the issue was used at the start phase of the design process to examine available favicon sites, 
user interfaces, user experience, conventions according to jakob's law, gaps noted on these sites and ways they can be improved 
and replicated on the new product.

How the issue was resolved _ the link above shows twelve [12] pictorial samples of existing favicon sites. With gaps and painpoints 
noted in the next issue below, as identified by regular favicon users.




issue name _ Painpoints, Brainstorming, Idea prioritization matrix, Features and User persona 
issue link _ https://github.com/zuri-training/favicon-gen-team-66/issues/84

Purpose of the issue - the issue continues with a user research by brainstorming on the painpoints received. 
So one of the painpoints are "no clear CTA buttons for the user to carry out the simple action of generating a favicon."
One of my ideas to resolve this problem is decongesting the interface and giving hierarchy to the design elements.

How was the issue resolved _ myself and my patner on this task, after brainstorming, we used the ideation priority matix
to identify which of the ideas where implementable according to the user's needs, imapact and effort. Then we came up with
the features list _ 
- Create a sign in and sign up feature to enable page credibility. 
- Create a visible and clear CTA button
- A favicon website will normally have a lot of FAQs but we can host all info in the documentation
- Alternatively, have an input box where user can litearlly see the code and copy from the box
- Create a third-party authentification through Google and some other platforms.
- we can have a gallery of recent downloads by user





issue name _ Check/Identify inbalance of elements and interfaces across the hifidelity mobile and web designs 
issue link _ https://github.com/zuri-training/favicon-gen-team-66/issues/74

Purpose of the issue - After the designers concluded with the high fidelity prototypes, The colours and final look
popped out some problems. I saw some issues with inconsistency in colours, large and small spacing, and too bold texts.

How was the issue resolved - I called the design lead to focus on the low fidelity prototypes, while I make these 
highlighted corrections for him to also replicate them on the low fidelity prototypes which I later checked to confirm
that the are in sync.





issue name _ Hifi Webpage Corrections 
issue link _ https://github.com/zuri-training/favicon-gen-team-66/issues/81

Purpose of the issue - The team had a meeting with the supervisor and we noted some corrections: inconsistencies in some
headers and footers, spacing, clearly differentiating the primary and secondary button.

How was the issue resolved - I called three of our active designers on Google meet, I said i will focus on the high 
fidelity web screen, another person on the mobile, another on the low fidelity web and the other on the low fidelity
mobile, and as I shared my screen, they view the corrections I made and they replicate on each screens. For the header and footer,
I simply took a block of header and footer that was good enough and duplicated it on other pages to achieve consistency. We observed
a few corrections our own like some text spacings and the need for a "create favicon" button below the home page aside from the hero page.
